    <h4> About Me. </h4>
    <p> I am from a small town in Minnesota and attend school at <strong> Luther College </strong> in Iowa. I am a senior this year and will 
    graduate this Spring. Over the last year I discovered I absolutely <em> love baking </em> and have started my own personal
    baking blog. Other than baking, I also love downhill skiing, hot tea, running slowly , reading novels, ice cream, water skiing, 
    driving alone, 60s pop, wedding dances, fresh strawberries , arranging flowers and staying up late. </p>
