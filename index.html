    <h4> A little about me. </h4>
    <p> I am from a small town in Minnesota and attend school at Luther College in Iowa. I am a senior this year and will 
    graduate this Spring (oh my). Over the last year I discovered I absolutely love baking and have started my own personal
    baking blog. </p>
    <p> Other than baking, I also love downhill skiing, hot tea, running slowly , reading novels, ice cream, water skiing, 
    driving alone, 60s pop, wedding dances, fresh strawberries , arranging flowers and staying up late. </p>
